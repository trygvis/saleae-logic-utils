Collection of tools for use with Saleae's Logic logic analyzer.

These tools are expected to be chained by using a unix pipeline like this:

logic_read -r 24MHz | logic_to_event | logic_wait_for_trigger -b 2 -f | logic_i2c_analyze -c 2 -d 3

This pipeline would

 * read from the logic with a 24MHz sample rate
 * convert the stream of bytes to a stream of events (bit 4 went high, bit 6 went low)
 * Wait for a specific trigger: falling edge on bit 2
 * Run a i2c analyzer on the data, clock is bit 2, data is bit 3

NOTE: This is not implemented yet, but that's the basic idea of usage.

Other possible pipelines:

 * Recording:

   logic_read -r 24MHz -s 10M | logic_to_event > log.event

 * Playback:

   cat log.event | logic_to_stream | logic_write

 * Pattern generation

   generate_i2c .. | logic_to_stream | logic_write

This would record 10 million samples, convert it to an event stream and store it

= The Commands =

logic_read: Reads from the Logic with the specified sample rate
 Output: ByteStream

pattern_generator: Utility to generate byte patterns with a specified sample rate
 Input:  pattern to generate
 Output: ByteStream

logic_to_event: Tool that take a ByteStream and generate an EventStream
 Input:  ByteStream
 Output: EventStream

logic_to_bytes
 Input:  EventStream
 Output: ByteStream

= TODOs =

 - Use a more useful external format, either protobuf or GTKWave's format directly.
 - Create logic_from_event to take an event stream and create a byte stream.
 - Create logic_write to write a byte stream.
